  * Generate some activity on our system by installing stress
   *  The stress tool is a workload generator that provides CPU, memory and disk I/O stress tests.
   * itâ€™s in the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository, so first we'll install the epel repository, then we'll install stress.
  ```
  sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
  sudo yum install stress -y
  stress --cpu 1
  ```
